# Monga

Monga (*not to be mistaken with [mango](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mango), a tropical fruit*)
is a subset of the [C programming language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)).
The goal of the project is to build a compiler for it, making use of some common tools such as
[Lex](http://dinosaur.compilertools.net/lex/index.html),
[Yacc](http://dinosaur.compilertools.net/yacc/index.html) and
[LLVM-C](http://llvm.org/doxygen/group__LLVMC.html).
